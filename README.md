#   Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

 My motivation to do this study guide was to get my feet wet in learning how to code and implement my new learned skills so I can start a new chapter in my life for my future career.
 Building this project has helped me understand what lies ahead and the challenges I will come across and have to conquer in the near future.
 So far I've learned how to work my way around gitbash and VSC. To create projects, make new branches, and merge my branches. While all making a pretty decent looking  web page; Which in my free time outside of this prework assignment look foward to adding another section for important links of infomation I've read just so its easier to come back to in the future
